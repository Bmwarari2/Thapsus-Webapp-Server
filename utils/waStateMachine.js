// utils/waStateMachine.js
//
// Decides what happens when a WhatsApp message arrives from a customer.
// Called by routes/waWebhook.js AFTER the inbound row is persisted and the
// inbox counters/SSE are updated — this module only produces side effects
// (bot replies, state transitions, operator alerts).
//
// Dispatch order:
//   0. Empty message — a sticker, a contact card, an unsupported
//      attachment. Nothing to answer, so nothing is sent; the inbox
//      already has it with the badge raised.
//   1. Onboarding — contact not yet 'active'. Leads with what we do and
//      what we charge, then invites a product link; the name and delivery
//      address are asked for while the customer is already waiting on a
//      quote, which is the only moment those questions cost nothing.
//      Name + address mints the Customer Code. No M-Pesa number is
//      collected — payments are identified from the M-Pesa statement.
//   1b. Product link — pages staff on WhatsApp and raises a sticky
//      toast in the inbox, whoever holds the thread. Only a person can
//      send a quote, and an unnoticed quote request is the most
//      expensive thing this system can drop.
//   1c. SHEIN product link with no cart — asks for the cart link
//      instead. A product link often won't open on our side and never
//      shows the size or colour picked. Said once per 30 minutes, and
//      not at all while a human holds the thread.
//   2. Tracking auto-reply — an 'active' contact texting a TRK-#### code
//      gets the order's live status back, no operator needed (Phase 4
//      self-service). Collection orders get collection wording — they
//      never enter dispatch.
//   3. Payment claim — "I've paid" / a pasted M-Pesa SMS gets an
//      it's-being-verified reply (never a handoff), the reference stamped
//      onto the open payment, and a staff alert. Runs BEFORE the
//      confirmation branch because "ok, I have paid" opens with a
//      confirm word. When nothing is open and the latest order is
//      settled, the reply is the parcel's live status instead.
//   3b. Quote confirmation — a "yes"-like reply while the contact has
//      exactly one order awaiting confirmation flips it to 'confirmed',
//      opens the awaiting_review payment row, and sends till
//      instructions. Anything ambiguous falls through to a human.
//   4. Everything else: when the Gemini layer is enabled (wa_settings
//      ai_enabled + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY), it answers from the operator's
//      knowledge base PLUS a live summary of this customer's own orders
//      (loadOrderContext), so "where is my parcel?" works without an
//      exact code. It can also decline in two distinct ways:
//        HANDOFF   → a person is needed (complaint, refund, a question
//                    about our service we can't answer): acknowledge,
//                    hand the thread over, page staff.
//        OFF_TOPIC → nothing to do with us (wrong number, general
//                    knowledge, jokes): say what we do, once an hour,
//                    and leave the assistant live. No alert, no takeover.
//      On any AI failure the message just sits in the operator inbox
//      (the webhook already bumped unread + SSE before calling us).
//
// The AI is consulted ONLY for onboarding interpretation and the final
// fall-through. Money and state (tracking replies, confirmations, quotes,
// payments, pipeline moves) run BEFORE it and stay fully deterministic.
//
// Human takeover: while wa_contacts.human_takeover_at is set (an operator
// replied, or the assistant handed off) the AI stays quiet. It clears
// itself after ai_resume_after_minutes of silence, or when an operator
// re-enables it for that chat from the inbox.
//
// State lives entirely on wa_contacts.state — no in-memory sessions, so
// deploys/restarts never lose a customer mid-onboarding.
