// utils/waNudges.js
//
// Revenue follow-ups. The conversation data for the first month said one
// thing loudly: the assistant answers instantly and accurately, and then
// nobody ever follows up. Twenty-six warm leads active in a single week
// were left after OUR reply ("feel free to send your cart whenever
// you're ready") and never touched again; every stalled quote had zero
// messages from us after the quote went out. WhatsApp gives a free
// 24-hour customer-service window after every inbound message — these
// nudges spend it.
//
// Three customer nudges + one staff page, all run from the sweeper:
//
//   1. Quote follow-up   — a quote 4–48h old with no customer reply gets
//                          one "we're holding it for you" message.
//   2. Browse-abandon    — a contact who asked about the service, got an
//                          answer, and sent no cart within ~16h gets one
//                          how-to-share-your-cart message before their
//                          window shuts. At most once per 14 days.
//   3. Repeat purchase   — a customer whose parcel was delivered or
//                          collected 20–72h ago, with nothing else in
//                          flight, gets one "anything else on your list?".
//   4. Stalled-quote staff page — a quote unanswered for 48h is a
//                          person's job now: a personal touch closes what
//                          a bot can't. Paged once, audit-trail claimed.
//
// Rules every nudge obeys:
//   - One send each, claimed BEFORE sending (audit event / transcript
//     marker) so a crash never double-nudges.
//   - Free text only inside the 24-hour window. The quote follow-up can
//     go out-of-window ONLY once a 'quote_reminder' template is approved
//     and mapped in Settings (see utils/waTemplateVars.js).
//   - Never while a human holds the thread, never to blocked contacts.
//   - Promotions come from wa_settings.promo_message — copy never
//     invents an offer or a date.
//   - Kill switch: wa_settings.nudges_enabled.
